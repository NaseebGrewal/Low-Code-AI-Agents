# 🤖 AI Agent with n8n: Automate Your Workflow Like a Pro!

## 🚀 Overview
I built an AI-powered agent using [n8n](https://n8n.io/) to streamline my workflow like never before! This agent seamlessly integrates with Google services to:

- 📅 **Schedule meetings** on Google Calendar effortlessly.
- 📂 **Retrieve relevant files** from Google Drive using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- 🎨 **Generate AI-powered images** directly in chat.

With n8n's powerful automation capabilities, this AI agent acts as a personal assistant, saving time and effort while optimizing productivity.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- [n8n](https://n8n.io/) - Low-code automation tool
- **Google Calendar API** - For scheduling meetings
