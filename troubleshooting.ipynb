    "# RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "### About asyncio event loop issue\n",
    "### This error happens because you're trying to call asyncio.run() while an event loop is already running (common in environments like Jupyter Notebook). There are a couple of solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>\n",
    "Option 1: Use await main() (in a Notebook Cell)\n",
    "If you're in an interactive environment (like Jupyter Notebook), simply run your coroutine with:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "await main()\n",
    "in a cell instead of calling asyncio.run(main()).\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 2: Use nest_asyncio\n",
    "If you prefer to keep using asyncio.run(main()), you can allow nested event loops by using the nest_asyncio package:\n",
    "\n",
    "Install it if needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "pip install nest_asyncio\n",
    "Modify your code as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "import nest_asyncio\n",
    "nest_asyncio.apply()\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "This applies a patch to allow nested event loops, which should resolve the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the option that best fits your environment.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Does that mean, this only happens when I run the code in jupyter like notebooks, not when I run the code from a normal .py file. This error happens because you're trying to call asyncio.run() while an event loop is already running (common in environments like Jupyter Notebook). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### About asyncio and Jupyter error \n",
    "## Yes, that's exactly right. In a standard .py file executed from the command line, there's no pre-existing event loop, so calling asyncio.run() works as expected. However, in interactive environments like Jupyter Notebooks, an event loop is already running in the background, which causes the error when you try to run another loop with asyncio.run().\n",

    "### will await main() also work in .py file or we have to call the asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "\n",
    "### In a standard .py file, top-level await (i.e. using await main()) isn’t allowed. You’ll need to use asyncio.run(main()) to start your asynchronous code. This is because the top-level await is typically only supported in interactive environments like Jupyter Notebook, while in a normal script you must initiate the event loop explicitly using asyncio.run()."
